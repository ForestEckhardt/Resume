{\noindent Internship at Pivotal worked to ship Pivotal Application Watchdog Team, which is an application that allows a user to track dependencies within other applications deployed on a Cloud Foundry instance. Helped to build CLI tool, participated in user research, worked with designer and product manager to improve the user experience of the tooling. Also helped to design ways of increasing the confidence of our CVE scans.}{\hfill June - August 2016}\\

{\noindent Internship at Pivotal on their Cloud Foundry Buildpacks Team worked with three other engineer to continuous deliver eight Buildpacks and Rootfs to open source community. Also worked to rewrote Ruby Buildpack in Golang as well as splitting two buildpacks (Dotnet and Ruby) to make them multi-buildpack compliant and helped prepare buildpack app lifecycle for multi-buildpack usage.}{\hfill June - August 2017}\\
